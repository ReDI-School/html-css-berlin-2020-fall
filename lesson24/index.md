# CSS Grid

So far, Flexbox has been a very useful tool for making flexible, responsive layouts. But, it only really let's us make layouts in one direction: Horizontal (Row) Or Vertical (Column). We cna combine multiple flex elements with nested flex children, but this can get a little tricky to keep track of.

Enter CSS Grid!

CSS Grid is a __2 Dimensional Layout System__ which can let us create layouts made up of both rows and columns.
