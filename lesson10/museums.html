  <h1>Museums in Berlin</h1>

  <h2>Pergamon Museum</h2>
  <p><strong>The Pergamon Museum was designed by Alfred Messel</strong>; its construction was overseen by Ludwig Hoffmann and lasted twenty years, from 1910 to 1930. A smaller building initially stood on the same site for a just few years before being torn down. It
    housed the important excavation finds unearthed by the Berlin museums, such as the frieze panels from the Pergamon Altar, reclaimed from the earth in digs that lasted from 1878 to 1886. Inadequate foundations, however, soon resulted in the
    building becoming structurally unstable and it had to be demolished.</p>

  <h2>Neues Museum</h2>
  <p>The opening of <strong>the Neues Museum</strong> marked a key chapter in the history of 19th-century art, museum design, and technology. Designed by Friedrich August Stueler and built from 1843 to 1855, the building <strong>suffered severe damage during World War II</strong>, after which it was left as an abandoned bombsite. Emergency measures to secure the structure were only taken in the 1980s.</p>
