# Let's Start our Websites

## Let's review now our paper prototypes

Now that we've learned a bit of HTML, let's review the paper prototypes from the first week and see if we can recognize
any of these elements there:

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists
- Navigation (they are unordered lists)
- Images
- Links

## Let's check:

- Do we still like what we did on the first week?
- Do we need to change or add something?
- Do we need all those pages?
- Now is the time to make those changes.

## Before coding, let's indicate the...

- website name with `h1`
- navigation with `ul` > `li`
- other headings we have (you decide what they are)
- text with `p`
- lists (ordered and/or underered) if we have
- links! What happen when you click here or there? Where that link will take you?
