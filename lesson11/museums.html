  <h1>Museums in Berlin</h1>
<div id="pergamon" class="museum">

  <h2>Pergamon Museum</h2>
  <p><strong>The Pergamon Museum was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Messel">Alfred Messel</a></strong>; its construction was overseen by Ludwig Hoffmann and lasted twenty years, from 1910 to 1930. A smaller building initially stood on the same site for a just few years before being torn down. It
    housed the important excavation finds unearthed by the Berlin museums, such as the frieze panels from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon_Altar">the Pergamon Altar</a>, reclaimed from the earth in digs that lasted from 1878 to 1886. Inadequate foundations, however, soon resulted in the
    building becoming structurally unstable and it had to be demolished.</p>
